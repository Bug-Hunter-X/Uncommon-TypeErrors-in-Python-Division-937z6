This repository contains examples of uncommon errors that can occur in Python, specifically focusing on type errors that arise during division operations. The code demonstrates how to handle the typical ZeroDivisionError, but also highlights the less frequently encountered TypeErrors that can occur when dividing incompatible data types.  The solution file offers a more robust approach to prevent these errors.
